GenerationOfCylinders
Fitting code: by Xingjiepan, “Cylinder fitting,” https://github.com/xingjiepan/cylinder_fitting, 2017.
Theory: D. Eberly, “Least squares fitting of data by linear or quadratic structures,” 2018.

run with:

```json
python3 main.py
```

Settings:

- nReplay: How many cylinder measurements should be simulated
- nheight: Number of measured heights for one cylinder
- ndata: A captured area has the dot density ndata \* ndata
- lengthStep: How many measurements around the circumference are simulated
- Ropt: Ideal radius of the cylinder
- plotVisable: Should there be a visual representation of the fit?
